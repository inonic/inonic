## What's inonic
Libra's whitepaper gives us so many imaginations,but you should accept this factor:facebook is a company,you are in danger of centralization,unfair or expensive cost when you use Libra.

So we copied libra's core code to create inonic.On the basis of libra's power infrastructure we are aiming to give people a more fair and cheaper block chain environment.

If libra was canceled for some political or economic reasons,we still continue inonic project.

## What's INNC
INNC is the coins of inonic.Now we have issued INNC by ETH smart contract.The total supply are 100,000,000.

Inonic's target is low centralization,so is coin.We decided to distribute 92% coins to peoples that are interested in inonic.

INNC is the only transaction coin in inonic net.After our main net was released.We will provide a tool to move INNC from ETH to inonic's main net.

As soon as 92% of all the coins was distributed,we will list INNC on at least two exchanges.

## How to get INNC?
We provide three ways to get INNC,they are all very easy to access.

- Be a supporter

If you are interest in inonic,and want be a simple supporter.Just send 0 ETH to the address: [0xae8Fc6AF004F256a4eCdDDD2F87aA26b51DA6f07](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae8Fc6AF004F256a4eCdDDD2F87aA26b51DA6f07).Once you send it,you may have 1/5 chance to receive 200 INNC. ``Be aware that each wallet have only one chance.``

**Warning**: ``make sure send it with your local ETH wallet other than a wallet of exchange.``

- Be a contributor

By twitter,reddit,telegram or write post,you can make more people know our project.We will provide total 3%*100,000,000 INNC for contributors.You can write a post of INNC attached with this link:https://github.com/inonic/inonic. Then send your eth wallet address and screenshot or url-link,which can prove your contribution,to the email address:``inonic@outlook.com``.You may get 200 to 5000 INNC according to the style and quality.

- Be a donator

This is the easiest way to get INNC.What you should do is to donator ETH to inonic project.

There are 5 hierarchies as follows:

- ``0.1 ETH = 5,000   INNC``

- ``0.5 ETH = 28,500  INNC``

- ``1   ETH = 60,000  INNC``

- ``5   ETH = 310,000 INNC``

- ``10  ETH = 650,000 INNC``

We recommend you do not donate more than 10 ETH,you should give other people a chance.

Also send ETH to the upper mentioned address: [0xae8Fc6AF004F256a4eCdDDD2F87aA26b51DA6f07](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae8Fc6AF004F256a4eCdDDD2F87aA26b51DA6f07),make sure use yourself ETH wallet to donate.

### **Additional prise**
```
The first 200 supporter can receive addition 80 INNC.

The first 100 donator who donates more than(or equal) 1 ETH can get addition 5000-50000 INNC(Each address only reward once).
```


## What is the usage of the left 8% INNC?
Contributor's 3% rewards come form this part. So we only leave 5% for the team.The 5% INNC can make the core team always have an impact on this project,to protect it not go to a wrong way.

## How to use the donated ETH

Our team members are all fanatical crypto-currency fans.We have enough money to run this project. So these little ETHs(total 1,500 or so) is not used for our team's daily spending.May be in the future,it can be used for awarding peoples who have done many helpful things for inonic.
